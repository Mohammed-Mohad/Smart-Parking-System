## Project Setup

- Initialize a new Vite project with React and TypeScript.
- Set up a Git repository for version control.

## User Registration and Authentication

- Set up a backend server (like Node.js with Express) or use a service like Firebase for user registration and authentication.
- Implement registration and login components in React.

## Parking Space Availability

- Design a data model for parking spaces.
- Create a service to fetch parking space data from the backend.
- Display this data in a user-friendly way in the frontend.

## Map and Navigation

- Use a library like Google Maps or Mapbox to display the parking facility layout.
- Implement navigation assistance using these libraries.

## User Feedback and Ratings

- Create a data model for feedback and ratings.
- Implement components for users to submit feedback and ratings.


## Mobile Responsiveness

- Use responsive design principles and possibly a library like Bootstrap or Material-UI to ensure the website looks good on all devices.

## Integration with Sensors and IoT Devices

- This is a complex topic and depends on the specific devices you're using. Generally, you'll need to set up a server to receive data from these devices and update the parking space data accordingly.

Each of these steps involves a lot of details and specific code. I suggest starting with the first step, and I can provide more detailed guidance and code examples as you progress.
